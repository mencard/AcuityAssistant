- **Standard Conversion**: Convert between Snellen (feet and meters), logMAR, decimal, MAR, and estimate near vision (M units and Jaeger).
- **Teller Acuity Cards**: For preverbal children, compare cycles per degree (cpd) at various test distances against normative data by age.
- **Near Vision Tools**: Convert between M units and Jaeger scale, and estimate correspondence with distance vision.
